			Thanks to FontStruct, I was able to produce a font for my game, <a href="sweet.html">SWEET.exe.</a><br>
			I kept the style very minimal to match the look and feel of the game. At first, I tried to convey each character with as few pixels as possible, but I found that it would take away from the "charm" of the font. Instead, I followed a few guidelines I set for myself:  
			<ul class="list">
			  <li>Lowercase character must be a minimum of 3 pixels and a maximum of 4 pixels high</li>
			  <li>Uppercase characters must be exactly 5 pixels high</li>
			  <li>No two characters should look the same</li>
			</ul>

		<p class="text">Much of the calligraphy you see in my portfolio was created when I was just learning how to use Illustrator for lettering and type. As an artist, I was much more familiar in working with rasterized formats, but I've since become much more proficient with directly working in illustrator, rather than simply using the trace tool.</p>

		<h2>BRUSH PEN (OLD)</h2>

		<p class="text">I recently got the hang of using pen and ink and hope to be at the level where I use these skills in my freelance work (and obviously, my portfolio). Using a brush pen is my method of choice when I letter. After writing "minimum" about 200 times, I was finally able to grasp the technique. The prevalence of this style of calligraphy does concern me though, and I do wonder if it's a fad that will die soon.</p>

		<h2>BLOCK LETTERING (OLD)</h2>

		<p class="text">This style was inspired by graffiti. It is a relatively simple process to put together the linework for this type of typography, but quite time consuming to get it <i>just right</i></p>
